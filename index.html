Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal

1. NO EVIL CLAUSE
        1.1 You shall not use the Software, in whole or in part, for any malicious purpose
            that intentionally harms or exploits "Our-Kind"—defined as human-kind, animal-kind,
            plant-kind, and the broader environment (including non-living elements essential to life).
        1.2 This includes, but is not limited to, developing technology or processes that
            are designed to cause, facilitate, or encourage physical, emotional, or ecological
            harm to Our-Kind.

2. KINDNESS CLAUSE
        2.1 You may use the Software for non-commercial and nonprofit purposes freely without
            further obligations.
        2.2 If you derive revenue—whether through direct commercial use, sale, or monetized
            distribution of the Software or its derivatives—you shall split a meaningful
            portion of your profits and donate it to respectable charities that serve Our-Kind.
        2.3 A "respectable charity" means a legitimate, vetted nonprofit organization that
            actively supports the health, welfare, or preservation of humans, animals,
            plants, or the environment.

3. LICENSE CONTINUITY
        3.1 You must include a copy of this License in any substantial portions of the Software
            you distribute or sublicense.
        3.2 Failure to adhere to the No Evil Clause or Kindness Clause immediately terminates
            your rights under this License.
        3.3 Once this License applies to the Software or any of its derivatives, it remains
            binding. You may not remove, replace, or otherwise obscure this License from
            any copy or modification of the Software.

        INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION
